## Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations: STIG Implementations - Win11 (Powershell)

## Introduction

In the world of cybersecurity, maintaining a secure environment is critical for mitigating vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. One of the most widely recognized frameworks for hardening operating systems and applications is the **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)**, which provides detailed configuration guidelines aimed at improving the security posture of IT systems.

STIGs are developed by the **Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)** and are used primarily by the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies. These guides contain a series of security requirements designed to mitigate common vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and reduce the risk of compromise. 

This repository is focused on automating the remediation of **STIGs** on Windows operating systems using **PowerShell scripts**. The scripts are designed to address specific security requirements outlined in each **STIG ID** and can be run in environments that need to adhere to DoD or similar security standards. 

Keep reading to see an example of how I handled a STIG implementation using PowerShell scripts for automation, I made use of **[stigaview.com](https://stigaview.com/products/win11/v2r3/)**, a comprehensive resource that provides in-depth insights into each STIG.
